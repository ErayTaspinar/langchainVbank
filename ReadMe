A full-stack AI chat application featuring a Blazor Server frontend and a Flask/LangChain backend. The system utilizes LangGraph for agentic workflow management, PostgreSQL for persistent memory and user management, and ChromaDB for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).



Usage
Registration:
Open the Blazor app in your browser.
Click Sign Up to create a user account.
Note: To access the Admin Panel, you must manually update the role column in the PostgreSQL users table to 'admin' for your specific user after registration.
Chatting:
Log in.
Type a query (e.g., "How do I fix this SQL error?" or "Find me a lasagne recipe").
The Agent determines the best tool (Internal Knowledge vs. Google vs. StackExchange).
Upload images to have the AI interpret code or describe scenes.
Admin Portal:
If your user role is 'admin', an "Admin Panel" button will appear in the top header.
View dashboard statistics regarding users and system usage.

Features
Frontend (.NET Blazor)
Modern UI: Responsive chat interface utilizing Bootstrap and custom CSS animations.
Authentication: Secure custom JWT authentication with Access/Refresh token rotation and Argon2id password hashing.
Admin Portal: Dashboard with statistics (User count, Chat count, Active sessions) and reporting capabilities.
Multi-Modal Input: Support for text and image uploads.
Real-time Interaction: Interactive Server components for seamless chat experiences.
Backend (Python Flask)
Agentic Workflow: Uses LangGraph to route queries intelligently:
Internal Knowledge: For Oracle/SQL specific questions.
Google Search RAG: For modern/general questions.
Stack Exchange: For legacy code questions.
Image Interpreter: Analyzes uploaded images for code or context.
Memory: Persistent conversation history stored in PostgreSQL.
Vector Store: ChromaDB integration for internal document retrieval.
LLM Integration: Powered by OpenAI/OpenRouter (GPT-4o-mini).

Tech Stack
Database: PostgreSQL (Relational Data), ChromaDB (Vector Data)
Backend: Python, Flask, LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI SDK, Psycopg
Frontend: C# .NET 8, Blazor Server, Dapper, Npgsql, Bootstrap
Security: JWT, Argon2, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Prerequisites
PostgreSQL Database: Installed and running locally or on a server.
Python 3.10+
Pre-requisite Keys:
OpenRouter (or OpenAI) API Key.
Google Custom Search API Key & Search Engine ID.
.NET 8 SDK

Database Setup
Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g., langchain_db). The application code (both C# and Python) contains logic to automatically initialize tables (users, chats, refresh_tokens, etc.) upon the first run, provided the credentials have CREATE TABLE permissions.
